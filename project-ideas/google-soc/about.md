As an NGO and a global volunteer community, HOT creates and provides digital and print maps, and builds technology to address the world's toughest challenges through the use and growth of [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/). In times of crisis and natural disaster, HOT rallies a network of volunteers worldwide to rapidly produce maps relied upon by humanitarian relief organizations to reach those in need. 

HOT believes strongly in the transformative potential of free and open source software to enable a global effort to tackle these challenges. Since 2010, the HOT community has worked to build the largest open mapping community of nearly 50,000 volunteers and a suite of 10 community maintained OSS software tools used by more than a dozen partner institutions including the Red Cross, MSF, Concern, USAID, World Bank, and the United Nations. Many of these tools support the editing, use, and analysis of OpenStreetMap data. 

The HOT Technical Working Group forms the basis for how open source software is developed within the community. The working group discusses and coordinates technology development across the HOT community. The group serves has the entry point for how needs on the ground are translated into projects that can serve and support the larger humanitarian community and local OSM communities. 

All of this work is done through [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/). OpenStreetMap is the community-driven free and editable map of the world, supported by the not-for-profit [OpenStreetMap Foundation](http://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Main_Page).
