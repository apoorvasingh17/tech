# Quarterly Goals

Quarterly goals is a place where the community can document direction and communicate focus on a quarterly basis. Openness is a key part of our mission and we want to share where and how we operate and invite others to participate. 

### Why have quarterly goals? 

Quarterly goals gives focus on the short-term. Setting bigger picture one or five year goals can be helpful but overwhelming. By setting smaller, achievable goals on a three-month basis, we can create focus and better monitor our progress. 

Setting quarterly goals also achieves two critical items in our community: 1) agreeing upon direction in smaller pieces; and 2) help us internally evaluate to improve how we communicate.
